"""Definitions for Itho sensors added to MQTT.

A sensor entity represents passive, read-only data provided by a device. It reflects the current state or measurement of something in the environment without directly interacting with or changing the device.
A control entity represents interactive elements that allow the user to send commands or configure a device to change its state or behavior.
A diagnostic entity provides device-specific metadata or operational insights that assist in understanding the device's internal state or functioning but is not directly related to the user's environment.

https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/#entity-description
By default the EntityDescription instance has one required attribute named key.
This is a string which is meant to be unique for all the entity descriptions of an implementing platform.
A common use case for this attribute is to include it in the unique_id of the described entity.

The defined keys within this integration are unique per Itho device. Some are re-used for several devices, such as 'Error'.
The key is also used to define the translation_key and to setup the unique_id of each sensor
